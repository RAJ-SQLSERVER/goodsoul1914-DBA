# Welcome along to the Undercover Toolbox!

All our tools are open source and we're always keen to welcome new contributers aboard and hear your ideas.  Please feel free to report bugs, request new features or code things yourself.

## Report Bugs

If you happen to stumble across any bugs in our code (however unlikley we know that is), please feel raise an issue for it an we'll look into it.

When raising an issue, please... 
  Detail the script or tool that you're referring to.  
  Give a full description of the bug including any error messages that you've recieved.  
  Detail the version of SQL Server that you're running.
  If possible, the line of code where the bug occurs.
  
The more information that you can give us, the better chance we've got of replicating the problem and fixing it.

## Request New Features

If you think of a new feature that you'd like to see included in any of our tools please raise it as an issue.  We'll take a look at it and if we like what you're suggesting, we'll look at incorporating it into a future release.

Before requesting any new features, please check our open issues to make sure that your idea is original and not something that we're already working on.

## Submitting Changes and Features

If you've got a new feature that you'd like to see added you've got a much better chance of getting it in if you can code it yourself.  Now, that's now because we're lazy but because we're all very busy working on private work, spending time with our families and working on our own Undercover projects.

#### Please, before starting work on any code, raise the change as an issue

We'll have a look at what you're suggesting and if we like the idea then we'll give you the green light.
