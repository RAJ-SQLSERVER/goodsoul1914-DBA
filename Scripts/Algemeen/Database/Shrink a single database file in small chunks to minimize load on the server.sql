Description:	Shrink a single database file in small chunks to minimize load on the server
Scope:			Database File

Notes:			Shrinking a file is a very bad habit, and it should be avoided as much as possible.
				When there is no choice, it is better to do it in small chunks and during low activity.
				The ideal chunk size is different for each system,
				so it might be a good idea to start with small chunks and increase them gradually.
